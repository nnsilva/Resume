<h1>My world, my hobbies</h1>

<hr />

<p>I enjoy working on projects with my children, practicing pilates, studying history and prehistory, and engaging in a range of art projects, including drawing, sewing, embroidery, painting, and playing bass. Connecting brings me joy, as does sharing the richness of life with purpose, gratitude, and compassion. </p>
